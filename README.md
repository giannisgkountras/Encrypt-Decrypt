# Encrypt-Decrypt
A text encryption-decryption program I created using Java.
When you open the program you can chose to **encrypt** a given text using your unique given **key**, or to **decrypt** a text using the **key** used to encrypt it.

You can use this program to send encypted messages that *no one* except **you** and **your friends** who know the key you used, will understand.

## In order to run the program

1) Make sure you have java installed. You can check using: ```java -vesrion```

      If not installed you can download and install it from here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

2) Make a new folder, download the files and put them inside the folder.

3) Open a command window inside the folder or navigate to your folder using  ```cd pathTo\Folder\ ```

4) Run  ```javac RunMe.java  ```

5) Run  ```java RunMe ```
