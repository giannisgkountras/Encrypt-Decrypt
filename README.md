# Encrypt-Decrypt
A text encryption-decryption program I created using Java.
When you open the program you can chose to **encrypt** a given text using your unique given **key**, or to **decrypt** a text using the **key** used to encrypt it.

You can use this program to send encypted messages that *no one* except **you** and **your friends** who know the key you used, will understand.


## Usage:
### Encryption:
Type 1 and press enter.

Type the key you want to use for the encryption. **You have to remember this key. You will have to use it to decrypt your text.**

Copy your encrypted text without including the [          ] surrounding it.

For example your coppied text should look something like this: 

```180, -29, -73, -289, -434, -626, -651, -858, -919, -1166, -1221, -1450```

You can send the encrypted text to anyone and they can decrypt it using the key.

### Decryption:
Type the key used for the text's encryption.

Paste the text you want to decrypt without including the [          ] surrounding it.

For example your pasted text should look something like this: 

```180, -29, -73, -289, -434, -626, -651, -858, -919, -1166, -1221, -1450```

The progam decrypts it and prints the original text.

## **In order to run the program**

1) Make sure you have *java* installed. You can check using: ```java -version```

      *If not installed you can download and install it from here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/*

2) Make a new folder, download the files and put them inside the folder.

4) Run  ```RunMe.bat```
