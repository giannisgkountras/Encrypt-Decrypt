# Encrypt-Decrypt
A text encryption-decryption program I created using Java.
When you open the program you can chose to **encrypt** a given text using your unique given **key**, or to **decrypt** a text using the **key** used to encrypt it.

You can use this program to send encypted messages that *no one* except **you** and **your friends** who know the key you used, will understand.
